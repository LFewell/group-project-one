# Pantry Meal Plannerz ReadMe

Description:
For this project we wanted to create a web based application that allowed the user to create a meal plan for the week based off what they already had in their pantry or fridge. This idea came to us from the many times that we have all just stopped and stared at ingredients that we have but have no idea what to make with them. This application allows the user to do just that and set their week up so they also do not waste time trying to figure out what they will make what day.
